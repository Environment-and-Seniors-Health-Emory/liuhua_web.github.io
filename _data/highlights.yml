  description: "This is the first nationwide population-based cohort study on air pollution and neurodegeneration. 
  We demonstrated that long-term PM2.5 exposures were significantly associated with an increased risk of first hospitalization with Parkinson’s disease, 
  and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. To accommodate massive datasets, we developed novel Cox-equivalent Poisson models to 
  perform a computationally scalable survival analysis."

- title: "The 2020 Report of the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change"

  description: "We contributed to “The 2020 Report of the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change” and developed a new wildfire indicator. The Countdown project is an international collaboration that brings together leading climate scientists, engineers, economists, political scientists, public health professionals, and public health researchers from 35 institutions worldwide to “track the relationship between health and climate change”. The 43 indicators and conclusions presented in this report are the cumulative result of the last eight years of collaboration."

- title: "Long-term exposure to air pollution may increase risk of Alzheimer’s, other neurological disorders"
  image: highlight_nc.png
  description: "This is the first nationwide analysis of the links between key criteria air pollutants—including fine particulate (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3)—and neurodegeneration incidence in the United States Medicare population. Of the pollutants analyzed, exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 showed the greatest risk for incidence of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with effects being the strongest for PM2.5. Exposure to O3 did not show an increase in incidence."

- title: "Temperature variability drives temperature-related changes in mortality"
  image: highlight3.JPG
  description: "This is the first study to examine long term effects of weather on annual death rates in a general population, 
  including people living in rural areas. We found, as expected, that warmer summer temperature increased death rates while warmer 
  winter temperature decreased death rates. More interesting was that in years when the variation of daily temperature was greater 
  in either winter or summer, more people died, and this effect was larger than the effect of average seasonal temperature. Unusual weather is bad for people’s health."
